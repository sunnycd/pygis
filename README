What is pygis?

A Python 2.5 code library that facilitates the generation of geospatial files ( .shp and .kml ), metadata and format to format conversions. Pygis is developed to interface with ArcGIS 9.3.

    Convert csv to kml (points, polylines, polygons)
    Merge multiple kmls (points, polylines, polygons)
    Convert shapefiles to kml (points and polygons)
    Convert csv to shapefile (points, polylines, polygons)
    Convert kml to shapefile (points and polygons)
    Automate shapefile metadata
    Generate shapefiles from databases (points and polygons)
    Generate file geodatabases (from csv, database)
    Other commonly requested tasks, such as
        Retrieving shapefile data
        Zipping geospatial files
        Converting excel files (.xls, .xlsx) to csv
        Filter csv (get only columns of interest)
        Converting Minutes Degrees Seconds to Decimal Degrees 


Odds and Ends

    This library was built using Python 2.5. NOTE: ArcGIS 9.X hardcodes the Python version.
    Currently, there is only a windows installation because the majority of the functionality in pygis interfaces with ArcGIS which is only available on windows.
    We hope to have an ArcGIS 10 version of this library soon.
        Although not thoroughly tested, this library appears to work on ArcGIS 10 
    If there is some functionality that you want to see and is currently not there, please feel free to submit a ticket and I'll see what I can do. Currently, the library only includes functionalities that were frequently requested.
    If you find a bug, please submit a ticket and I'll fix as soon as I can.
    You may be required to download and install external python libraries. Any required libraries are noted in the examples below.
